For the moment, this is to reinforce understanding of React/CSS/HTML & C#. In the future, I plan to add more features as time becomes available with classes.


### Planned features
**Note:** that this is not in order of when it will be done
* Some kind of backend
  * Unknown what this might turn out to be
* Small chatbot
  * At first, this will more than likely be implementing something similar before training an SLM/LLM for the task.
* More styling
  * At the moment, the sight is styled to give an old retro terminal feeling to it. As time goes on I want to improve this.
* Text animation
  * Flavor for visual effects and transitions between comps
* SFX
  * I'll poke one of my friends to see if they can assist in getting small SFX or BGM.
